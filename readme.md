# Book_ratings
## Intro

This is a project that will be looking at book ratings for a couple thousand books. The project is not large and compared to some of the other projects that I have recently been working on, it is quite small. The data set for this project may be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k.


# Getting started
### Installing

1. Clone the repo
2. Run [sudo] pip3 install or pip3 install flask
3. Run python3 main.py to run the application
6. Visit localhost:5000 to see the application

### Technology Stack

1. Flask-0.12
2. Python-3.4
3. Pandas-0.18.1
4. Numpy-1.11.0
5. MySQL-5.6.26

### Operation

Once the program is downloaded, simply run the program as you would any other python program.
Then follow the address, which your console/terminal tells you to go to see the
website.

# Issues

The one aspect of this project that I do not like is the search feature to get a specific book's rating. In order to return a value back, the book title has to be entered exactly the same way as it is in the CSV file. Thus, It must be It and not it. Yes, I could use the .title() method but how to solve a book title like The Girl on the Train? Where on and the have to be lowercase. So, to do this I believe Regex would have to be used and something that I will look into at a later date.
